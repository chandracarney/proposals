# Crafting your own Onboarding Experience

## Abstract

In our industry, a good onboarding experience is an exception than the norm. This pattern needs to change, given the influx of new developers joining us. There are many reasons behind lack of effective onboarding programs, most notable being limited resources. Therefore, I want to share strategies to developers joining a new team take charge of their onboarding experience. These strategies are borne out of my experience, both as a new developer and as someone helping onboard a new team member.

## Details

The talk describes an ideal progression for a new programmer joining a team and frames it as a series of firsts: things that new members should focus on their first day, first week, etc. It then dives into the process of working solo on the first bug and the first feature. It highlights how working solo provides beginners with a playground to test their knowledge while giving them the opportunity to explore new areas of the application and the problem domain. It goes on to cover some caveats and ways to minimize and/or avoid their negative ramifications. It explores ways folks can continue their growth upon successfully onboarding with the team. It ends with brief look at pertinent resources and likens the onboarding process to Agile Software Development as they both champion embracing uncertainties and making progress through small, deliberate steps.

The intended audience are programmers who have limited experience starting on a new team. However, I am confident that experienced programmers will find these strategies useful as well. I have successfully applied most of these strategies when I have switched teams. I have also used the concepts here to help a new person joining our team get comfortable with the codebase and the software development process. The talk will also help experience programmers understand the challenges a new person joining the team enabling them to improve the current onboarding process at their respective organizations.

## Pitch

As someone who came to the Ruby community with a computer science background and programming experience, it was *still* challenging to strike a balance between learning the problem domain and the technical stack while delivering value. The progression I describe in the talk, in many ways, is the kind of experience I wish I had when I was starting out. I do not want the new programmers coming to our industry to suffer through the same challenges and figure all of this out on their own. Furthermore, I want to start a conversation about we can work towards making onboarding experiences better and RailsConf will provide the perfect platform to achieve that goal.

## Noob Journey with Sandi Metz's POODR 

As a noob, with no prior programming
experience, reading Sandi Metz's Practical Object-Oriented Design in
Ruby was a love, hate, and finally love again
journey. Her presentation of the concepts were so beautifully simple,
how could one NOT feel like designing an app would be as easy as
riding a bike? Inspired by Sandi's wise words, I embarked on a
refactor where I was hell-bent on righting the wrongs of
my past design decisions and creating an epic object-oriented
masterpiece. 

This talk is an accounting of a very humbling journey. The story is told through code examples from the refactor,
and a story line that follows a famous Nike ad, ‘Falling in Love in Six Acts’:

+ Act 1: LUST: "This is it. The big wow. The thing you've been waiting
  for." 
  Several months into my six month programming school, I start reading Sandi's book,
  and I am instantly smitten. I totally "get it". I can do this in my own code! I have just the project for it... 

+ Act 2: EUPHORIA:  "You feel you can do anything and no one would dare
  laugh at you." 
  This refactor will be epic. It will channel 
  purist extremes. Models backed by the database will be pristine entities 
  of only their data attributes, devoid of any extraneous methods that I was previously too lazy to
  pull into service objects. And those service objects will have
  service objects, all interacting blissfully in a sea of
  single-responsibility.

+ Act 3: FEAR:  "This is the where the doubt begins, where the mind
  comes back from shopping." 
  So am I overboard? Am I doing extra work for no return? Will this matter in the real
  world?

+ Act 4: DISGUST: "Now comes that unavoidable time when you say to
  anyone who will listen: what the heck am I doing anyway?" 
  The purist view is just that - a view. You won't see it in the real world, ever.
  It is anything BUT practical. And I have a deadline to meet. 

+ Act 5: THE TRUTH: "It's easy to love something when you don't have to
  work at it. It's harder when it asks something of you." 
  Well, I'm already over half-way in this refactor. I can't quit now. And I don't want to half-ass
  it. I committed to the extreme, so let’s see what happens.

+ Act 6: THE FINALE: "There is something to be gained from commitment.
  There are rewards for staying when you would rather leave." 
  I learned the most from this project. I had real ownership. And now I know what is possible. And I will be a better programmer for it.

Learning to program is hard. Really caring about the craft of the code you write is enough to make you
bonkers. And you have to love the struggle as much as the result. Maybe more.

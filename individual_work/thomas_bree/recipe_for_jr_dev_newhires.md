## Execution plan for Jr. Dev Newhires

Schools are outputting Jr. Developers increasingly. And companies are hiring
Jr. Developers increasingly. And while the future certainly looks bright for the up and coming noob cadets,
there are still seemingly a lot of companies who will only entertain Sr.
Developers. What are some of the common hangups about hiring Jr. Dev's?
And what are some successes from those companies who regularly hire and
employ a formal onboarding and mentorship program for Jr. Dev's?

With a case study approach, focused on a handful of companies,  
we'll explore the following in this talk:

+ The ratio of Sr. to Jr. Developer job postings
+ The varying rationale small, midsize, and large businesses cite for
  hiring one over the other. Whether they have a specific approach in
  skill level mix.
+ Various approaches in mentorship programs within companies.
+ A look at the resource numbers that a company has to consider when
  investing in Jr. Dev's and their perspective on how the return on that
  investment is measured.

Having a starting recipe for absorbing and onboarding Jr. Dev's, which
can be scaled and customized for teams with varying budgets and needs, is
value ad for any size company.

## Branding for Open Source Success

If you build it, they "might" come. Competition in the open source
landscape is fierce. Reaching levels of notoriety and adoption akin to
the likes of Linux, Rails, or WordPress is increasingly challenging
amongst today's volume of seemingly never-ending options. How do you
differentiate in a way that is meaningful, not only to your fellow developers, 
but also to non-developers who may span any variety of interest or specific consumer niche?

In this talk we'll explore:

+ The up-and-coming open source rock stars. Identifying commonalities in
  their approach to brand, content and marketing communications.
+ Some brilliant basics for establishing a communication approach for an open source
  project of any size/nature, so that it is clear, concise and most
  importantly - easy for other people to talk about.
+ Positioning your open source endeavor beyond just a product
  you communicate/offer, but rather a brand with a personality that
  people want to engage and find a cultural connection.
+ Taking the time to consider your product outside the venue of what it does, 
  and focus on 'why' you do it -- and how that 'why' can manifest as your 
  brand identity.
+ Brand and cultural considerations to keep in mind as the project grows, 
  changing hands between team members, maintainers, contributers, etc.

When you take the time to deliberate on what it means to be a brand,
you are investing in a 'who', not just a 'what'. The aspect of a human,
emotional connection, as part of your project's identity, can leave a
lasting impression, garner stronger team unity, and ultimately create
advocates.
